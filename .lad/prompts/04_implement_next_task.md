**Sub-Plan Support:**
- If a SUB_PLAN_ID parameter is provided, load `plan_{{SUB_PLAN_ID}}.md` and `context_{{SUB_PLAN_ID}}.md` instead of the default plan/context files.
- After each task, update context files for subsequent sub-plans (e.g., update `context_0b_*.md` after 0a, etc.).
- Track completion and integration for each sub-plan. On sub-plan completion, verify integration points and update the next sub-plan's context.

**Pre-flight Check:**  
1. If there are any previously checked tasks in the current plan file (i.e. lines marked `- [x]`), re-run their tests:
   ```bash
   # run only tests for completed tasks
   pytest -q --maxfail=1 --lf
   ```
2. If any of those tests now fail, diagnose and repair the break before proceeding.  

**Scope Guard:** Before making any edits, identify the minimal code region needed to satisfy the current failing test. Do **not** modify or delete code outside this region.  
• If the file you're editing exceeds ~500 lines, pause and:
  1. Identify the next 200–300 line logical block.
  2. Extract it into a new sub-module via a separate prompt.
  3. Commit that change before proceeding with other edits.
**Forbidden Actions**
  - Never delete or move existing functions/classes unless **all three** conditions hold:        1. Ask the user to run coverage externally:
         ```bash
         coverage run -m pytest [test_files] -q && coverage html
         ```
         then wait for user to confirm **coverage complete** and check 0% coverage.
      2. Confirm the function/class is **absent from Level 2 API docs**.
   - **If both checks pass**, Copilot should prompt the user:
      Delete <name>? (y/n)
      Reason: <brief justification>
      (Tip: use VS Code “Find All References” on <name> to double-check.)
**Safety Check:** After applying changes but before running tests, verify that unrelated files remain unaltered.

Implement the **next unchecked task** only from the current sub-plan.

**Workflow**
1. **Write the failing test first.**  
   • If you need to store intermediate notes or dependency maps, write them to `docs/_scratch/{{FEATURE_SLUG}}.md` and reference this file in subsequent sub-tasks.  
   • If the next sub-task will touch >200 lines of code or >10 files, break it into 2–5 indented sub-sub-tasks in the plan, commit that plan update, then proceed with implementation.

2. **Modify minimal code** to pass the new test without breaking existing ones.  
3. **Ensure NumPy-style docstrings** on all additions.  
4. **Run** `pytest -q` **repeatedly until green.**

5. **Update docs & plan**:  
   • If `SPLIT=true` or SUB_PLAN_ID is set → update any `docs/{{DOC_BASENAME}}_*` or `docs/context_{{SUB_PLAN_ID}}.md` files you previously created.  
   • Else → update `docs/{{DOC_BASENAME}}.md`.  
   • **Check the box** in your plan file (`plan_{{SUB_PLAN_ID}}.md` or `plan.md`): change the leading `- [ ]` on the task (and any completed sub-steps) you just implemented to `- [x]`.  
   • **Update documentation**:
     - In each modified source file, ensure any new or changed functions/classes have NumPy-style docstrings.
     - If you've added new public APIs, append their signature/purpose to the Level 2 API table in your context doc(s).     - Save all doc files (`docs/{{DOC_BASENAME}}.md` or split docs).

5.5 **Quality Gate**  
   • Run flake8 and quick coverage as described in .copilot-instructions.md.  
   • If violations or low coverage, pause and show first 10 issues, ask user whether to fix now.

6. **Draft commit**:
   * Header ↠ `feat({{FEATURE_SLUG}}): <concise phrase>`  ← **one sub-task only**  
   * Body   ↠ bullet list of the sub-steps you just did.

7. **Show changes & await approval**:  
   Output `git diff --stat --staged` and await user approval.

**When you're ready** to commit and push, type **y**. Then run:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<header>" -m "<body>"
git push -u origin HEAD
```
