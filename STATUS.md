# STATUS — EMUSES
_Last touched: 2026-07-30_

## Goal
A predictive modelling tool for neuroimaging research, usable at three scales: local model
development by individual researchers, collaborative sharing within labs, and a public model
registry with peer review for the wider community.

## State of play

**Branch**: `fix/security-dependency-updates`, 13 commits ahead of `main`, not yet merged. Despite
the name it is a grab-bag: dependabot fixes, NIfTI affine correction, the workshop poster figure,
ADR tracking, and this session's LAD v2 migration.

**Core system is built and merged.** Model registry (all three deployment modes), scientific
pipeline, inference, multi-user auth, observability and CI/CD are all on `main`.

**Web GUI is not implemented.** Both `feature/web-gui-gradio` and
`feature/web-gui-gradio-implementation` merged, but they carried planning documents only — there is
no gradio code or dependency anywhere in the tree. Planning lives in `dev-docs/web-gui-gradio/`.

**Tooling**: LAD is now a Claude Code plugin (`lad@lad` 2.1.0), not a `.lad/` subtree. Static
guidelines are in the `lad:lad-standards` skill. The codebase is indexed in codebase-memory-mcp as
`home-chrisfoulon-neuro_apps-emuses` (14k nodes), with rationale in `.codebase-memory/adr.md`.

**Test suite**: `python scripts/dev_test_runner.py` → 13/13, the pre-push gate. A full `pytest` run
currently reports 121 *collection* errors from missing analysis dependencies (`hdbscan`) in the
active interpreter — an environment problem, not repo breakage.

## Decided strategy

- **Models are atomic folders**, not separable components. The registry is a folder lookup service
  and nothing more. This was violated once and had to be reverted; see `.codebase-memory/adr.md` §2.1.
- **Test locally before pushing** — `dev_test_runner.py` on feature branches (13 tests, ~1 min),
  full CI reserved for `main` (~30 min). Deliberate, to conserve GitHub education credits.
- **Real data over synthetic** in tests. Converting InferenceStage tests from `np.random.rand()` to
  `test_data/` fixtures took that suite from 44% to 83% passing — the failures were the synthetic
  data, not the code. See `dev-docs/test_quality_conventions.md`.
- **Never hardcode absolute paths.** In-repo paths derive from `PROJECT_ROOT`; external datasets come
  from `EMUSES_TEST_DATA_ROOT`. A hardcoded Windows path had silently broken the session pipeline
  fixture for months.
- **Documentation split**: `docs/` is user-facing, `dev-docs/` is for contributors and sessions.

## Open questions / next

- [ ] Run `/lad:converge` — nine months of accumulated claims have not been checked against the
      code. Two were already found and fixed on 2026-07-30 (a stale "ready for merge" banner, and
      `CLAUDE.md` naming a deleted branch as current); the rest of the sweep has not been done.
- [ ] Decide what to do with `fix/security-dependency-updates` — merge to `main` or split the
      unrelated work out. It is carrying five distinct concerns.
- [ ] Install the missing analysis dependencies so full `pytest` runs mean something again.
- [ ] `dev-docs/issues/synthetic_test_data_conversion.md` — the 2025 "Phase 3" conversion was never
      executed. 208 `np.random.rand()` instances remain across 27 test files. Triage before bulk
      converting; some are legitimately random.
- [ ] `dev-docs/issues/optim_dict_resume_conflict.md` — Optuna parameter space conflicts on resume.
      Deferred, workaround exists.
- [ ] Multi-user admin endpoints (`emuses/multi_user_service/admin_endpoints.py`) are mock
      implementations returning fake data. Documented in
      `docs/multi_user_service_implementation_gap_analysis.md`. Non-blocking for single-user use.
- [ ] Delete or keep `test_name_logic.py` at the repo root — a print-only demo with no assertions.
